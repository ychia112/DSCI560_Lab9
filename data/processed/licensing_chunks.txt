11Floating Licenses
Floating Licenses
In case of a floating (network) license , the Keysight EEsof software application is installed on one or
more client machines and uses the environment variable <PRODUCT>_LICENSE_FILE to point to
the license server. Both license server manager (lmgrd) and vendor daemon (agileesofd) run on the
license server system.
Figure: Floating License Setup
Licensing (For Administrators)
12Node-locked Licenses
Node-locked License
Anode-locked license permits the software to run on only one machine. Both license server
manager (lmgrd) and vendor daemon (agileesofd) run on the local machine for which the license is
issued.
Figure: Nodelocked License Setup
Licensing (For Administrators)
13Recognize License Type
You can determine the license type to be node-locked or floating by looking at the INCREMENT
lines in your license file.
Node-locked License
The INCREMENT line corresponding to a node-locked license embeds the CPU ID of the license
server machine or the FlexNet ID of the dongle in the HOSTID= part of the statement.

22License File Syntax
License File Syntax
This section provides a brief overview of the syntax of the statements included in the License
Codewords section of the license file. For further details, refer to the License File Syntax in FlexNet
Publisherâs License Administration Guide .
The License Codewords section, usually contains three pieces of information: the SERVER line, the
VENDOR line, and all the INCREMENT lines representing the licensed codewords.
SERVER Line Syntax
Keysight supports both single server and redundant servers, as per FlexNet standard configurations.
In case of single server, the SERVER line syntax is:
SERVER this_host <hostid> [port]
In case of redundant servers, the SERVER line syntax is:SERVER<hostname1><hostid1><port>SERVER<hostname2><hostid2><port>SERVER<hostname3><hostid3><port>where,
hostname1, hostname2, hostname3 are the system host names or IP address. String returned by the
hostname oruname âncommand on UNIX; or by theipconfig /allcommand on Windows. Note that
redundant servers should all have the same OS, that is, you cannot have one server on Windows, and
another on Linux.
hostid, hostid1, hostid2, hostid2 are usually the string returned by thelmhostidcommand. This is
specified in the issued license file by Keysight EEsof.
Port is the TCP/IP port number to use. This is an optional field for single server configuration, but is a
required field for redundant server configuration. A valid number is any unused port number between 0
and 64000. On UNIX, choose a port number greater than 1024, because anything less than or equal to
1024 are reserved. If no TCP/IP port number is specified, one of the default ports in the range of 27000
through 27009 is used.
this_hostis the generic host name for the computer for which the node-locked license is issued, and
can be used as is without replacing it with the real computer host name in that case.
Licensing (For Administrators)
23VENDOR Line Syntax
The VENDOR line specifies the vendor daemon information. The VENDOR line syntax is:
VENDOR agileesofd [<path_to_agileesofd> agileesofd ] [ [OPTIONS=]
<options_file_path> agileesofd.opt] [ [PORT=] port]
Example 1
VENDOR agileesofd
Example 2
VENDOR agileesofd C:\Program Files\Keysight\EEsof_License_Tools\bin\agileesofd
C:\Program Files\Keysight\EEsof_License_Tools\bin\licenses\agileesofd.opt
PORT=5346
where,
agileesofd is the name of Keysight EEsof vendor daemon.
C:\Program Files\Keysight\EEsof_License_Tools\bin\agileesofd is the full path-
name to the vendor daemon executable.
C:\Program Files\Keysight\EEsof_License_Tools\bin\licenses\agileesofd.opt
is the full path-name to the FlexNet options file.
5346 is the specified TCP/IP port number for the vendor daemon.
INCREMENT Line Syntax
The INCREMENT line specifies information about a licensed codeword. Codeword name, vendor
daemon name, license version, license expiration date, license count, and vendor string are some of
the important information included. The INCREMENT line syntax is:
INCREMENT <feature> agileesofd <license_version> <license_expiry_date>
<license_count> VENDOR_STRING =<Keysight_eesof_vendor_string> [ HOSTID
=<hostid>] START =<license_start_date> SIGN =<encoded signature to
authenticate this INCREMENT line>

25Licensing Attributes
Keysight EEsof Licensing Behavior is administered by the following attributes:
User-Display-Host (UDH)
License Security
License Counting
Job Control
User-Display-Host (UDH)
All Keysight EEsof licenses are counted, with User-Display-Host as the base of forming the license
checkout identify. Each unique User-Display-Host consumes one count of a license. Additional
licenses are required if user, display or host is changed. For example, the following cases would
cause an additional count of license to be checked out:
A second user logs on the same host. This is because user is changed.
The user moves to another terminal and launches another session of the product. This is because
display is changed.
License Security
All Keysight EEsof licenses are secured by codewords, which are tied to a CPU ID or aUSB dongle .
CPU ID: Specifies the unique ID of a computer. It uses the physical address (hostid) of your computer.
USB Dongle: Uses the dongle ID (or the FlexNet ID) of your USB dongle.
Our licensing scheme supports counted node-locked licenses and floating licenses.
Node-locked License: A node-locked license can be used on a specific computer to which the license
is tied. It allows an Keysight EEsof Product to be used on a single computer with a single display by a
single user. The user, license, and computer must physically co-locate.
Floating (Network) License: A floating (network) license can be shared among multiple users across a
computer network. Floating license support is provided for a single and multiple servers (including
distributed product servers, peak servers, and redundant servers). With a floating license, an individual
feature contained in a bundle orelement can be run locally or remotely by a single user.
Keysight's Licensing, on a best effort basis, supports remote access via Windows Remote Desktop,
VNC, Citrix, and Exceed. A floating license is required for remote access. This functionality is not
supported with a node-locked license.
Example
A user starts an ADS session on Computer A. One core bundle with simulator license is checked
out. If the same user tries to launch another ADS session using Remote Desktop, an additional
license will be checked-out because the host has changed.
Licensing (For Administrators)
26License Counting
Keysight EEsof licensing supports only counted licenses. The count associated with a license
specifies the maximum concurrent use of that license. Each Keysight EEsof license comes in the
form of a bundle or an element, which in turn contains one or more features.
Figure: Bundles and Elements Composition
When a license count limit is reached, that license is no longer available for additional use.
Job Control
Some features contained in a bundle or an element, are job controlled. Job control limits the
concurrent use of a feature. Simulators and models are typically job controlled features. Most job
controlled features have a job-control limit of one-Harmonic Balance simulator, Momentum
simulator, LTE wireless library are examples of this classâand some have greater than one limit to
support parallel computingâMomentum turbo, 8-pack transient/convolution, quad-pack
GoldenGate simulation are some of the examples of this type.
In Contrast to job controlled features, non job-controlled features entitle a single UDH to share one
count of the license unlimited times. Environment GUI features are typically of this type.

2.FlexNet Version Compatibility
FlexNet Version Compatibility
FlexNet has a strict version compatibility rule that must be followed to ensure proper licensing
behavior. Following are the key basic compatibility rules:
lmgrdversion must be greater than or equal to vendor daemon (agileesofd) version.
Vendor daemon (agileesofd) version must be greater than or equal to the software applications.
Starting from October 2013, Keysight EEsofâs new releases can no longer start up, if the above rules
are not followed. The following error message gets displayed instead:
TheLicense Server/Client Mismatchwarning message is displayed when the installed version of
license server (lmgrd) and vendor daemon (agileesofd) appears to be older than the minimum
required version. This warning message also displays the minimum required version.

âªLicense Codeword Version Compatibility
License Codeword Version Compatibility
Each Keysight software release comes with a base license codeword version requirement. The base
license codeword version is the minimum number that enables a release to run. Some versions of
Keysight EDA software also have an upper limit of the codeword version that software release
enforces. This upper limit is set for an additional two versions beyond the base version. The
software cannot run if the codeword version exceeds that upper limit.
When you mix codeword versions on a license server and a user runs different versions of a
product that use different base license codeword versions, extra licenses may be pulled and
result in unexpected â Licensed number of users already reached for
this feature â errors. To avoid this either have all your licenses updated to use the latest
codeword version, if possible, or separate the licenses by codeword version and put the two sets
onto separate license servers.
When you mix codeword versions compatible for a given product release version with codeword
versions that exceed the upper limit for that same product release version, that product release
version would take a longer time to obtain a license due to the additional requests made to
FlexNet server until a compatible license version is found. To avoid such a license checkout
performance degradation, we strongly recommend you to separate out a compatible set of
licenses from those exceeding the upper limit for a given product release version and put the
two sets onto separate license servers.
For License version compatibility of older releases, see License Version Compatibility (Unsupported
Releases) .
The following chart summarizes the license codeword versions compatible with each Keysight EEsof
software release.

Figure: EEsof Licensing Behavior
Licensing (For Administrators)
36Session Start-up Flow
While initiating an Keysight EEsof product session, if only one type of a bundle license is available
on the license server, it is checked out and the software session starts immediately. However, if
there are multiple bundle types to choose from, theProduct Selectorwindow is displayed, which
allows the user to choose the most appropriate license to start with. You can preselect a license as
the default for future sessions. To do so, in theProduct Selectordialog box, select the license and
checkAlways try to start with this selectionoption. Once checked, new start-up will automatically
attempt to check-out the preselected license without displayingProduct Selectorin subsequent
sessions. If the pre-selected license is denied, and more than one license is available to start the
software, thenProduct Selectordialog box will be displayed once again.
For more details onProduct Selector, refer to the Product Selector section.
CAD administrators can assign a startup bundle for a user and/or suppress theProduct Selectorfrom
appearing by using the following environment variables:
<PRODUCT>_PRODSEL_AUTOSTART
<PRODUCT>_PRODSEL_PREVIOUS
Refer tosection for more details.
Active or In-Session Flow
Once the start-up license is checked out, all subsequent license requests follow the logic depicted
in the diagram above. In a nutshell, the start-up license is always attempted first; if fails, Elements ,
Primitives, and Bundles are attempted in that order; also, within each group, the least capable is
attempted before the more capable ones.
FlexNet provides addition controls, such as EXCLUDE, MAXIMUM, for the CAD Administrators to limit the
license usage. For details, refer to the FlexNet Publisherâs License Administration Guide .

Setting Up Floating License on Windows
Setting Up Nodelocked License on WindowsBoth node-locked and floating licenses require license server to get installed and started.
For a node-locked license, license server and the client machine are the same machine
(that is, your local machine). For a floating license, these can be separate machines.î
Licensing (For Administrators)
38Setting Up Floating License on Windows
Setting up floating licenses on Windows is a two-step process where both server-side setup and
client-side setup are needed.
Step 1: License Server Setup
To setup a dedicated floating license server that has no Keysight EDA software installed, you will need
to download and install the EEsof EDA License Server Software . This will install the license daemons and
utilities needed to configure and start the license server.
Repeat the following steps for each license server you have.
For licenses tied to a CPU ID , follow the steps 1 and 2 described in the Setting up Node-locked
License on Windows section.
For licenses tied to a USB Dongle, follow steps 1 through 3 described in the Setting up Node-locked
License on Windows section.
Step 2: Client Setup
Once the license is configured successfully for all the license servers, configure each client
computer to point to the network license server.License Setup Wizardoffers the easiest method to
get this done Alternatively, you can perform this step manually by following step 3 of Setting up
Node-locked License on Windows section. Make sure to specify the network license server in the
format of port@host.domain or if no static TCP port is used on the license server, use the format
@host.domain.
Examples
27001@myServer.myCompany.com
@myServer.myCompany.com
In case a license server is down or is running slow, it is recommended to remove it from the server list
using theLicense Setup Wizardto avoid any performance degradation caused by the dead/slow
servers.

2.Setting Up Nodelocked License on Windows
On Windows, the License Setup Wizard offers the easiest way to set up your node-locked license .
We strongly recommend you to use theLicense Setup Wizard, especially when you have multiple
Keysight EEsof products installed on one computer. For more information, refer to Quick Install-
Windows. This section describes how to set up a node-locked license manually, should you decide
not to use theLicense Setup Wizard.
Do not perform manual setup steps with theLicense Setup Wizard. Choose one method or the other.
License Setup Wizardmay not be able to replace what you set up manually due to Administrator
Privilege differences.
The following instructions assume that you have already installed Keysight EEsof Licensing Tools in
C:\Program Files\Keysight\EEsof_License_Toolsfolder. In case you have not yet installed the tools,
run the Keysight EEsof Licensing Tools installer on the machine to which the license is tied to.
If you have installed an EEsof product released before 1stAugust, 2014 on your system prior to
installing an EEsof product released after 1stAugust, 2014 then the default EEsof Licensing tools
path will remain C:\Program Files\Agilent\EEsof_License_Tools. On the
systems that only have EEsof products released after 1stAugust, 2014 installed then the default
EEsof Licensing tools path will be C:\Program
Files\Keysight\EEsof_License_Tools.
Make sure to save the license file on the same machine where you install the Keysight software.
License tied to a CPU ID
The following 3-step process shows how to manually set up a counted license that is tied to a CPU
ID.
Step 1: Start License Server Managers
Start the FlexNet license server managers (lmgrdandagileesofd) on the computer to which the
license is tied as follows:
Open the MS-DOS command prompt and change directory to the following path:C:\Program
Files\Keysight\EEsof_License_Tools\bin.
Specify the full path and location of the license file and the license log file, respectively, by typing the
following command:
lmgrd.exe -c <license file path> -l <license log file path>
where,
<license file path> specifies one or more full path-names to the license file(s).
<license log file path> is the full path-name to the debug log file.

License tied to USB Dongle
The following 4-step process shows how to manually set up a counted license that is tied to a USB
Dongle.
You can move a dongle between systems after performing this license setup process for each computer
you intend to run Keysight EEsof product(s) using the dongle license(s). If multiple dongles are swapped
from one computer to another, be sure to include all the licenses associated with those dongles during
the setup process.
Step 1: Attach Dongle
Make sure that the dongle is securely attached to the USB port of your computer. Some systems
may require up-to a few minutes to detect the dongle, therefore, make sure to keep sufficient time
before the next step.
Step 2: Install USB Dongle Drivers
The USB Dongle drivers ( FlexNet ID Dongle Device Drivers ) need to be installed once on each
computer that is intended to run Keysight EEsof product(s) with dongle license(s). The supported
USB dongle is Wibu Key (aka FLEXid 10) dongle.
The USB dongle drivers can be found under the license installation tree. To install the drivers, run
theSetup64.exefromC:\Program
Files\Keysight\EEsof_License_Tools\bin\FLEXID10_Windows_v6_30_x64.
If you currently do not have a Wibu Key dongle, contact Keysight EEsof Business Support.
Step 3: Start License Server Manager and Create Windows Service
Follow the steps 1 and 2 described in the License tied to CPU ID section.

2.Setting Up Node-Locked License on Linux
This section describes how to set up a node-locked license on Linux.
The given instructions assume that you have already installed Keysight EEsof Licensing Tools either
in the EEsof product installation tree, or in a dedicated location. The former happens automatically
when you install Keysight EEsof product on the Linux platform; the latter happens when you
separately download the Keysight EEsof Licensing Tools from Keysight download website and
install the package to a dedicated location. In the former case, you can find all the licensing tools
and binaries under<PRODUCT_INSTALL_DIR>/Licensing/<license tools version>/linux_x86_[32|
64]/bindirectory. In the latter case, you can find all the licensing tools and binaries in the
<LIC_INSTALL_DIR>/bindirectory. For convenience, <LIC_PATH> is used in the rest of this chapter
to represent the directory where the licensing libraries and executables are located.
Make sure to save the license file on the same machine where you install the Keysight software.
License tied to CPU ID
The following 3-step process shows how to manually set up a counted license that is tied to a CPU
ID.
Step 1: Start License Server Managers (lmgrdandagileesofd)
Start the license server managers (lmgrdandagileesofd) on the machine to which the license is
tied as follows:
Change the directory to the <LIC_PATH>
Run the following command to start lmgrd :
./lmgrd -c<license file path>-l<license log file path>
where,
<license file path> specifies one or more full path-names to the license file(s).
<license log file path> is the full path-name to the debug log file.
Step 2: Automate FlexNet License Server Startup
To automate the License Server managersâ startup upon system reboot, add something similar to
the following sample script in the system boot services directory or/etc/rc.d/init.d.
#!/bin/sh
#
# Sample FlexNet startup script for restarting EEsof License Server

Once you implement your version of the FlexNet startup script using the above sample, follow the
steps below to complete the automation:
Change to the system boot services directory:/etc/rc.d/init.d
Create a startup script in the system boot services directory: EEsof_lmgrd_restart
Insert your FlexNet startup script into this script.
Set the permissions for this script, as shown:chmod755EEsof_lmgrd_restartchownrootEEsof_lmgrd_restartchgrpsysEEsof_lmgrd_restartFor license servers, run the command: /sbin/chkconfig --add EEsof_lmgrd_restart
Follow the steps below for RHEL 7 and Suse 12:
Perform Step 1 to 4 from above.
Create a system service (EEsof_lmgrd.service) file with below entries in the system boot services

473.[Install]WantedBy=default.targetExecute the systemctl enable EEsof_lmgrd.service command from the terminal.
The license server will be auto started at RHEL 7 and Suse 12 as soon as the system is restarted.
Step 3: Set Product Environment Variable
Set the product specific environment variable <PRODUCT>_LICENSE_FILE to point to the machine
running the license server managers (lmgrdandagileesofd). For example, for ADS, it is
ADS_LICENSE_FILE, for GoldenGate, it isGOLDENGATE_LICENSE_FILEand so on. For details, refer
toLicense Environment Variables section.
This environment variable can be set in the user login startup file such as.cshrc(for C shell) or
.profile(for Bourne shell) in the$HOMEdirectory. Alternatively, these variables can be set using
command-line as well.
csh, tcsh, cshrc command for setting <PRODUCT>_LICENSE_FILE
setenv <PRODUCT>_LICENSE_FILE <license file pathname>
Example Product=ADS
setenv ADS_LICENSE_FILE $HOME/Keysight/Licenses/license.lic
ksh, bash command for setting <PRODUCT>_LICENSE_FILE
export <PRODUCT>_LICENSE_FILE=<license file pathname>
Example Product=GoldenGate
export GOLDENGATE_LICENSE_FILE=$HOME/Keysight/Licenses/license.lic
Repeat this step for each Keysight EEsof product you have installed on your Linux computer.
To use multiple Keysight EEsof Products at the same time, setup the license by merging license files for
each product and starting up the License Server Managers as described in step 1 .
License tied to USB Dongle
For the Linux platform, the following 4-step process shows how to manually set up a counted
license tied to a USB dongle.
You can move a dongle between systems after performing this license setup process for each computer
you intend to run Keysight EEsof product(s) using the dongle license(s). If multiple dongles are swapped
from one computer to another, make sure to include all the licenses associated with those dongles
during the setup process.

5.Step 1: Attach Dongle
Make sure that the dongle is securely attached to the USB port of your computer. Some systems
may require up-to a few minutes to detect the dongle, therefore, make sure to keep sufficient time
before the next step.
You can move a dongle between systems by placing a copy of its associated license file on each system
and moving the USB dongle from one system to another. Each system must have the license(s) setup for
use.
Step 2: Install USB Dongle Drivers
The USB Dongle drivers need to be installed once on each computer that is intended to run
Keysight EEsof product(s) with dongle license(s). By default, the USB dongle drivers are bundled
with the product installation files. They are available in the dongle_sup directory once youuntar
the installation image.
To install these drivers on your local machine, follow these steps with the appropriate drivers from
the table below:
Disconnect the USB dongle from your local machine.
Change the directory to<untar installation image>/ dongle_sup .
Use the Red Hat Package Manager (RPM) to install the drivers. For example, to install 64-bit Flex-10
Wibu dongle driver, execute the following command:
rpm -i WkRt-Lin-6.32.1504-500.x86_64.rpm
The following table shows all available dongle drivers being packaged in the installation image.

Select Product License
You can select an available license inProduct Selectorto start the software. Only one license can
be selected at a given time.
You can assign pre-selected license as a default choice for future sessions. This license is used
automatically whenever a new session invoked. To pre-select a startup license, select the pre-
selected license and checkAlways try to start with this selection. Once checked, in subsequent
sessions, software startup will automatically attempt to check out the pre-selected license without
displayingProduct Selector. If the pre-selected license is denied and more than one license are
available to start the session, then theProduct Selectordialog box will be displayed once again.

Licensing (For Administrators)
56Accessing Licenses through a Firewall
You can access (checkout) FlexNet licenses through a firewall (or router) as per your license
agreement. To enable license checkout, configure your firewall to allow TCP/IP communication
through the TCP ports used by the license manager daemon (lmgrd) or vendor daemon (
agileesofd).
Step 1. Specify TCP Port Numbers
Specify a TCP port number forlmgrdon the SERVER line and foragileesofdon the VENDOR lines.
Be sure to stop and restart the license servers after you modify the port numbers.
Example
Step 2. Configure Firewall
Configure your firewall (or router) to allow TCP communication through the TCP ports you specified
in Step 1.
Step 3. Set Environment Variable
At the client-side, set the <PRODUCT>_LICENSE_FILE environment variable to the port number
assigned to the license server, as shown:
<PRODUCT>_LICENSE_FILE=27000@myserver.myDomain
After you set the environment variable, clients outside of the firewall will be able to access licenses
from your server.
Some clients may timeout before they can connect to a license server through a firewall setup on
Windows. The default timeout period is 0.1 second. If you need a longer timeout period, you can modify
FlexNet environment variable FLEXLM_TIMEOUT to a larger value. Refer to FlexNet Publisherâs
License Administrator Guide for details
Licensing (For Administrators)
57Creating Options File
AnOptionsfile allows administrators to control the following licensing parameters of FlexNet:
Retricts and/or reserves the use of features based on user, hostname, or display name.
Controls the level of information logged about license usage.
You can create anOptionsfile using any text editor.
Ideally, you should keep this file in the same directory as your license file.
For details on how to create an Options file, refer to the FlexNet Publisherâs License Administration
Guide .

2.License Environment Variables
This section describes the environment variables specific to Keysight EEsof licensing scheme. At
most two locations are used to resolve these environment variables, and in the order shown below:
System Environment for the user
Unified License Configuration Location:
Operating System Key Name
Windows XP/7 HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Keysight\EEsof License
Configuration
Unix $HOME/.eesoflic
Variable Name Description
<PRODUCT>_LICENSE_FILE Specifies the list of license files/servers to search when a license is
requested by a given Keysight EEsof Software.
Each Keysight EEsof software has a dedicated variable to serve this
purpose:
ADS_LICENSE_FILE
ICCAP_LICENSE_FILE
EMPRO_LICENSE_FILE
GENESYS_LICENSE_FILE
SYSTEMVUE_LICENSE_FILE
GOLDENGATE_LICENSE_FILE
AMA_LICENSE_FILE
MBP_LICENSE_FILE
MQA_LICENSE_FILE
WAFERPRO_LICENSE_FILE
It is automatically set by theLicense Setup Wizard. The license file
path must not contain any
special characters like |,@and semicolon( ;) on Window or a
colon( :) on Linux.
These are used as separator characters.
It is recommended to use the License Manager to
set the <PRODUCT>_LICENSE_FILE
variable. If the <PRODUCT>_LICENSE_FILE
variable is set to a new license file (or if the
contents of a license file are changed), then the
license server managers (lmgrdandagileeosfd)
must be restarted for the change to take effect.
This will be done automatically by the License
Manager. If the license server managers are not
restarted, then the EEsof software may not be
able to checkout a license. For information on
starting the license server managers, refer
toSetting Up Licenses on Windows orSetting Up
Licenses on Linux .

installation process.
Set this variable toonor1to turn off the wizard invocation.
<PRODUCT>_PRODSEL_PREVIOU
SProduct Selectorautomatically records the name of the license selected
to start the software session in this variable. This variable can be used in
conjunction with <PRODUCT>_PRODSEL_AUTOSTART variable to
pre-select a license as the
default startup license; when the pre-selected license is available at the
startup of the next
software session, theProduct Selectordialog box does not get displayed.
Each Keysight EEsof software has a dedicated variable to serve this
purpose:

<PRODUCT>_PRODSEL_AUTOSTA
RTIt automatically records the state of the check-box "Always try to start with
this selection.
It is set to TRUE when check-box is checked. This variable can be used in
conjunction
with <PRODUCT>_PRODSEL_PREVIOUS variable to pre-select a
license as the
default startup license. When this variable is set to a value other than 0
orFALSE ,
the value recorded in <PRODUCT>_PRODSEL_PREVIOUS is used
automatically when a new software
session is started. In case, where there is only one license in the licensing
pool qualified to
start the new session, this variable has no effect;
in all the other cases, if no <PRODUCT>_PRODSEL_PREVIOUS is
specified or if the new session cannot be started
with the specified license, theProduction Selectordialog will be displayed.

5.Variable Name Description
AGILEESOFD_DEBUG_MODE Turns on the debug mode in vendor daemon when this variable is set to
anything other than 0,nooroff. Since this variable is only read at server
startup, you need to stop and restart the license server to allow this setting
to take effect.
Alternatively, Vendor daemon debugging can also be turned on/off using
aglmutil without having to stop and restart the license server. Follow the
instruction below:
Find the licensing tools installation
directory. One method is to invoke the
License Manager tool, select the
"Environment" tab, look for the path
recorded in the environment variable
"HPEESOF_LIC_DIR ".
cd<pathname recorded in HPEESOF_LIC_DIR>
aglmutil âc @myServer.myDomain <cr>
ads_schematic <cr>
-vdebug on <cr>
The server debug log will be recorded into
the file denoted by the environment variable
"AGILEESOFD_SERVER_LOGFILE " that can also be
found in the "Environment" tab of the
License Manager tool.
HPEESOF_DEBUG_MODE Controls the client-side licensing debug mode. Any value other thanOFF
turns on the client-level debugging.
Debug messages are written to stderr unless AGLM_DEBUG_LOG is
set.
This value should be set before you start the Keysight EEsof software of
interest.
AGLM_DEBUG_LOG Sets the name of the client-side licensing debug log file.
This should be used in conjunction with HPEESOF_DEBUG_MODE
variable.
AGLMERR Suppresses licensing related error and warning messages. The value of this
variable is a list of keywords. When any of the keywords appear in the
contents of the licensing message, that message is suppressed i.e. that
message is not displayed. For example, if a user wants to suppress the
license expiration warning message that gets displayed at the software
startup time everyday during the first 30-day period before the license is
about to expire, include the keyword âexpiringâ as a value in this variable.

Keysight EEsof licensing scheme supports all the popular server configurations supported by
FlexNet. This includes the redundant servers as well as the multiple servers. Refer to the FlexNet
Publisherâs License Administration Guide for details.
Licensing (For Administrators)
62Remote and Distributed Simulation Licenses
Keysight EEsof supports remote and distributed simulations for Circuit and Momentum Simulators.
Remote simulation requires a floating license in the licensing pool; the distributed simulations,
usually run remotely, requires special distributed licenses.
Remote Simulation Licenses
Where supported by the product, a floating simulation license is used to run a single simulation on
a remote machine.
For more details on Remote Simulations for:
ADS Circuit Remote Simulation, see Circuit Remote Simulation
ADS Momentum Remote Simulation, see Using the Job Manager
GG Circuit Remote Simulation, see Remote Simulation
Distributed Simulation Licenses
Distributed simulation allows you to run multiple simulation jobs in parallel usually on multiple
machines remotely. Simulation Manager is used to launch distributed simulations for Transient,
Convolution, S-Parameters and Channel Simulators along with Batch Simulators in ADS and circuit
Simulators in GoldenGate (GG). Job Manager is used to run distributed simulations for Momentum
in ADS and GG.
Following types of Distributed Simulation licenses are offered:
Distributed Computing N-pack Simulation License
Quad-pack Simulation License (GoldenGate Only)
Distributed Computing N-pack Simulation License
Where supported, Keysight EEsof offers distributed N-pack (or Turbo) licenses to support a cost-
effective method to accelerate simulation sweeps, where N is the number of concurrent parallel
jobs supported (typically, N = 8). This is a reserve license up-front model in which simulation
controller reserves simulation licenses up-front and only launches as many simulation jobs as
granted.
A distributed N-pack license supports N parallel simulation jobs which perform a sweep of multiple
parameters on a single circuit (like frequency, power, temperature, a variable, Monte Carlo, or
corner analysis).
Licensing (For Administrators)
63A standard simulation license is checked out first before an N-pack distributed license. The
standard license acts as a controller. If you require more than N sweep points to be simulated,
multiple count of N-pack licenses can be stacked to accommodate greater parallelism.
A distributed computing N-pack license is limited to the same simulation type (that is, Momentum,
Transient, and so on).
A distributed computing N-pack license feature bits are bundled together and cannot be shared
between users or different circuits.
In case of a Distributed Computing N-pack Simulation license, the N-pack license is checked out at
the initiation of a distributed simulation (if available) and is released only once the sweep jobs are
complete. As jobs are completed the license is still reserved to complete additional jobs, if needed
on the existing sweep. This guarantees that the sweep is complete and also guarantees a
reasonable rate of job acceleration. For example, you have only one count of 8-pack distributed
license in the licensing pool and you want to distribute the sweep to 12 jobs. In this case, 8 jobs will
start in parallel and as each job finishes, the remaining jobs (4) will start automatically using the
same 8-pack license.
In case, when no N-pack license is available, Momentum uses the standard license obtained and
run simulations using all the sweeps are completed sequentially. On the other hand, in case of
transient, convolution and channel simulator, multiple jobs are launched as per request and each
job pulls the standard simulation license.
For more details on distributed simulation on:
ADS Circuit Distributed Simulation, see Distributed Simulation Using Simulation Manager
ADS EM Simulation, see Using the Job Manager
Quad-pack Simulation License (GoldenGate Only)
Quad-pack Simulation Licenses support 4 simultaneous simulation jobs of multiple types (transient,
harmonic balance, circuit envelope tied to the license) which can be used to sweep multiple
parameters of one or more circuits. The Quad-pack Simulation licenses do not require standard
simulation licenses to be pulled first. This is a first-come, first serve licensing model, with all jobs
launched at the same time having equal opportunity to have the licenses granted.
In contrast to Distributed Computing N-pack Simulation license, when a user requests for, say, 20
jobs, but only two counts of the quad-pack licenses are available. In that case, all 20 jobs are
launched at once, but only 8 are granted with the quad-pack licenses and able to perform the
simulations; the other 12 jobs wait until quad-pack license is released by the first 8 jobs, and each
will start its simulation once granted with the license.
For more details on Distributed Simulations in case of GG, refer to GG Circuit Distributed Simulation
Licensing (For Administrators)
64License Retry
By default, the license auto-retry time is set at one hour for all simulations that are launched
remotely. Within that period, the previously failed license checkout request is attempted again in
every 2 minutes, until either the license is granted, or the retry period times out.

2.Licensing FAQs
Licensing - FAQs
The following table lists the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) on Licensing.
Question Answer
Where can I find different licensing
tools such as lmgrd ,lmutil ,
etc.?Windows: C:\Program
Files\Keysight\EEsof_License_Tools\bin folder
Linux (64-bit): <PRODUCT_INSTALL_DIR>/Licensing/<license
tools version>/linux_x86_64/bin directory
On the Linux platform, if you choose to install licensing tools to a dedicated
location outside of any Keysight EEsof product installation tree, then you
can find all the licensing tools and binaries in <LIC_INSTALL_DIR>
directory.
How can I determine theagileesofd
version before installing or
running any EEsof product?There are two versions associated withagileesofd: the Flexera Publisher
version and the EEsof licensing tools version.
To determine the Flexera version,
type: âagileesofd -vâ
To determine the EEsof licensing tools version on Windows
Right click onagileesofd.exein Windows Explorer and select
Properties.
Select theDetailtab in the Properties.
The Product version is the EEsof licensing tools version.
To determine the EEsof licensing tools version on Linux:
type: âstrings agileesofd | grep EESOFâ
The Flexera version of lmgrd must be greater or equal than
the version of agileesofd and the Flexera version of
agileesofd must be greater or equal to the Flexera version
supported for the product (such as, ADS).agileesofdis not
updated for every release of EEsof licensing tools, so it
may have a lower version number. Refer to product release
notes for details on minimum version of
agileesofd required to run the product.
Where should I copy my license file?On the Windows platform, Keysight recommends you to copy your license
file to C:\Program Files\Keysight\License\EEsof folder.
Can I change the port number in my
license file?You will not normally need to modify your local node-locked license file.
Licenses provided by the Keysight Software Manager (KSM) will have a port
number of 27009 on the SERVER line. If you do want to use a different port
number, then you need to modify them all of your EEsof license files for a
Licensing (For Administrators)
661.
2.Question Answer
given license server to have the same port number in order for the license
server to recognize them and start properly. The License Setup Wizard
(beginning with Licensing version 2017.01) will check that all of the license
files use the same port (or all have no port). Refer toAccessing Licenses
through a Firewallsection in the Advanced Licensing Configuration chapter.
Can I access the license activity log
file?For the local node-locked license set up by the License Setup Wizard, you
can find out the location of the license activity log by either of the following
method:
Start the License Setup Wizard and click Details. Click on the link
shown for the license log file opens the log file in a text editor.
Start the License Manager, and go to the âEnvironmentâ tab. The
entry for AGILEESOFD_SERVER_LOGFILE contains the
clickable link that opens up the log file in a text editor.
For the floating license set up on the network license server, consult
your CAD Admin to find out where the log file is located.
I am using valid Combo License but I
still get "License Denial" message.The license checkout denials could be recorded in the license activity log
when you use a combo license file that contains both version 2.8 and 3.0
licenses. You can ignore these messages as they don't have any impact on
using the product.
Why do I need to set environment
variable
<PRODUCT>_LICENSE_FILE ?<PRODUCT>_LICENSE_FILE is used by each Keysight EEsof product
to identify the licensing configuration for that product. Refer toLicense
Environment Variablessection in the Advanced Licensing Configuration
chapter for more details.
Why am I getting "License Denial"
message?Occasionally you may receive a license denial message unexpectedly. When
that happens, you should check to see if there are any "run-away" EEsof
processes that need to be killed, because those run-away EEsof processes
might be holding on to the license.
Why should I turn off
FLEXLM_TIMEOUT?FLEXLM_TIMEOUT is used by Flexera when connecting to a license server.
The default value of 3 seconds (3000000 microseconds) is sufficient to allow
remote connections with typical latencies. It generally will not need to be
changed. This value is also used when scanning for port when no port is
specified in the license file or in the server string. If you
know that there are no latency issues with a server you can reduce the value
of FLEXLM_TIMEOUT.Then minimum possible value is 200 milliseconds
(200000 microseconds). Keysight recommends using a port number and not
changing FLEXLM_TIMEOUT.
Do I need to explicitly specify TCP/IP
port?Not specifying the TCP/IP port for the license server during license setup
may lead to checkout delays, unexpected behavior, and/or license checkout
failure on the Windows platform. Therefore, it is highly recommended to
always explicitly specify the TCP/IP port associated with each license server.
What license version do I need?Check Product Release Notes first. Refer to License Version to Software
Release Compatibility Table for details on license version to use.

67Question Answer
What do I do to clean my existing
license setup?When you suspect that your license setup is outdated or behaving weirdly, a
quick way to clean up your existing license setup and force a reload and
recreation of the license servers and service on the Windows platform is the
following:
Start the License Setup Wizard.
Choose "I want to add or replace my license file" and click "Clear"
followed by "Next" to clear your previous license file setup.
Choose "I want to add or replace my license server" and click "Clear"
followed by "Next" to clear your previous license server setup.
If your existing license setup is still not cleaned up completely, run
lmtools located in the <LIC_PATH> folder to clear the
Windows Service related to Keysight EEsof licensing: "EEsof EDA
License Server", which can be found in the "Start/Stop/Reread" tab.
How do I determine if I am using the
latest agileesofd vendor daemon?To determine theagileesofdvendor daemon, you must check the following:
The startup information for the version string (agileesofd
)EESOF 2016.05 (XXX) , shown in the example below.
Compare the date stamp with what is installed. It must be dated

from Keysight EEsof. It might also be useful to access this information when
you place a call to Technical Support. There are two ways to check this:
Before you install the hardware key on your PC, you can read the ID
directly from the key.
If you have installed the hardware key on your PC, and have also
already installed your licenses and the FLEXnet software, enter the
following command to check the nodelocked ID:

2.Troubleshooting License Problems
This section discusses a troubleshooting flow to diagnose license failures. The most important thing
to understand is that licensing works with a server machine and client machine. A third party tool,
FlexNet Publisher by Flexera software makes it possible. The server machine (that runs license
server ) offers licenses held in a pool. The client machine (that runs the Keysight EEsof application)
communicates with and requests licenses from the license server machine. It should be noted that
the license server and the license client can be the same machine.
License problems can be categorized into the following:
One or more problems with the license server setup
One or more problems with the license client setup
A combination of first two types
A communication problem between license server and license client
Prerequisites
FlexNet utilities, run from the command line, are a fundamental tool used in the license
troubleshooting process. Further, many of the FlexNet utility commands make reference to the
license server machine (and this is regardless if the license server is a local machine or remote one).
Given this, to perform the troubleshooting process, one needs to know:
Where to access the FlexNet utilities for command line use
How to reference license server
Product specific license settings
Where to Access the FlexNet utilities for Command Line Use
Windows
InvokeLicense Managerfrom Keysight EEsof Softwareâs Main Windowsâ Tools menu.
Select theEnvironmenttab.
In theEnvironmenttab, look for the variable, HPEESOF_LIC_DIR . Make note of this path (for
example,C:\Program Files\Keysight\EEsof_License_Tools)
Open up a command prompt window
Change directories as follows:
cd <Path from step 3>\bin
Linux
Assuming that you have installed 2012.xx version of an Keysight EEsof product onto
<PRODUCT_INSTALL_DIR>, you can find FlexNet utilities under<PRODUCT_INSTALL_DIR>/Licensing/
2012.08/linux_x86[32|64]/bindirectory.
Alternatively, if you have installed Keysight EEsof Licensing package onto a dedicated directory,
<LIC_INSTALL_DIR>, you can find FlexNet utilities under<LIC_INSTALL_DIR>/bindirectory.
Licensing (For Administrators)
72How to Reference License Server
For debugging use of FlexNet with Keysight EEsof Products, port@license-server-machine is
typically used. This is a generic representation for the license server.
Port is a TCP port number that is optionally assigned for the license server.
License-server-name is the name of the license server machine. This can be a remote machine
or local machine. However, it should be noted that this can also be the IP address of the machine.
Examples

Troubleshooting Flow and Process
This section covers the suggested troubleshooting flow as follows:
Step 1 : Verify license server machine is running, FlexNet daemon versions, license server
communications.
Step 2 : Verify client is able to access license server machine.
Step 3 : Verify pool and accessibility of available licenses.
If your Keysight-EEsof application is unable to start, start with Step 1 .
If your Keysight-EEsof application is able to run but you have a license problem during
application runtime, start with Step 3 .

4.Step 1: Verify license server machine is running, FlexNet daemon versions, license
server communications
Run the following FlexNet lmutility:
lmutil lmstat -c <port>@<license-server-machine>
In the above, a status query is performed on license server 27001@apricot (apricot is the name
of the license server machine). The following information is obtained:
License file for server is located on the license server machine at/hfs/d1/local/License_Server/
<License server machine>_server_license.lic..
lmgrd isUPmeaning that it is running.
agileesofd isUPmeaning that it is running.
Version number for both lmgrd and agileesofd isv11.11 each.
As part of initial troubleshooting, you must ensure that the path to license file is correct,lmgrdand
agileesofdare both UP, the version numbers forlmgrdandagileesofdare both v11.11 for each.
To use this troubleshooting flow, go through the list of conditions in the given sequence. Jump to
different subsequent conditions as guided.
CONDITION 1: Running lmutil lmstat -c <port>@<license-server> displays
something as following:
If the path to license file is not shown and information aboutlmgrdandagileesofdis not given, then
one or more of the following possible problems may exist. If the above message is not seen or
presented differently or license path is given withlmgrdandagileesofdbeing UP, move to the next
condition .

c.USB dongle not plugged in: If license server uses a license file that is tied to a USB dongle, check to
see if dongle is plugged in appropriately.
USB dongle driver not installed: If license server uses a license file that is tied to a USB dongle, check
that the dongle driver is installed by running FlexNet command: lmutil lmhostid --
flexid . If "missing dongle driver" is reported, follow the Dongle License Installation instruction to
install it.
Wrong License Server Name is used in command: Ensure that you have the correct name of the license
server. Depending upon your DNS configuration in place, it may be necessary to provide fully qualified
domain name (for example, @computername.companydomainname.com ) or the IP Address of the
license server machine (for example, @130.29.167.44 ). If using a local license server, the local
machine name may be replaced with localhost (for example, lmutil lmstat -c
@localhost ).
Network connectivity (Remote license servers): Ping remote license server to ensure it is on the
network. Not getting a ping respond could mean the machine is physically disconnected from the
network or turned off.
License server not running: There could be several causes for this. However, before investigating
further, for Windows machine, it is advisable to restart the machine whereLicense Setup Wizardwas
run.
Check process on the license server for presence oflmgrdandagileesofd. If any of them is missing,
follow the Install License Server instructions to start the same.
Examine license file and ensure CPU ID in the installed license file matches with CPU ID of the
machine. Run the FlexNet command:lmutil lmhostidto acquire the CPU ID of machine so that the
CPU ID in the license file can be matched up with the CPU ID of the machine.
Only oneagileesofdprocess may be running at a time on a license server machine. Check processes
on the machine for presence of already running instance ofagileesofd. This could be due to multiple
services (Windows or Linux) previously set up on the same machine. If this applies, explore the services
on the machine to ensure that only one exists for Keysight EEsof software.
Running on unsupported platform: License servers are supported on the supported operating
systems for our products. Ensure that the license server is on a supported operating system . It must
be noted that Virtual machines (for example, VMWare, Windows virtual machine) and Linux
distributions other than Red Hat Enterprise Linux or Novell SuSE are not supported (for example,
Ubunto, Fedora).
License Path problem:
On Windows: RunLicense Setup Wizard: Verify if the wizard show that the correct license file is
being pointed to.
On Linux: Check if license file specified in lmgrd invocation been moved or deleted or the
correct file is used inlmgrdcommand.
FlexNet communications blocked: See special section on dealing with blocked FlexNet
communications.
CONDITION 2: Running lmutil lmstat -c <port>@<license-server> reports lmgrd
being UP,agileesofd being UPbut does not report that both lmgrd and agileesofd
versions are v11.11 .
Iflmgrd and agileesofd are reported UPwith version v11.11 , move to the next condition .
The FlexNet lmgrd and agileesofd daemons have to be upgraded to FlexNet v11.11 for both
lmgrd and agileesofd on the license server machine. The bits can be acquired at http://
www.keysight.com/find/eesof-flexnet-downloads .

being UP,agileesofd being UP,lmgrd and agileesofd versions are v11.11 , but reports
the wrong path and/or license file:
Determine the correct location of the license file.
On Windows: Re-runLicense Setup Wizardto re-configure for correct license file.
On Linux: Stop and re-start license server with correct license file.
Step 2: Verify client is able to access license server
At this stage in the debugging process, the license server is presumed to be working correctly and
focus is shifted to the client side. To remind again, both server and client can be the same machine.
These are the items to check on the license client machine:
License Path specified for the Keysight EEsof application
Remote server only: Communications problem from client machine to remote server
License Path specified for the Keysight EEsof application
The Keysight EEsof software application obtains licenses from the license server machines that are
specified in the license path. Each Keysight EEsof application has a dedicated variable for holding
the license path information. This variable is written to the Windows registry on Windows or
entered into one's environment on Linux. It takes on the format of <PRODUCT>_LICENSE_FILE .
<PRODUCT>_LICENSE_FILE can be one of the following depending upon which product you are
using:
ADS_LICENSE_FILE
EMPRO_LICENSE_FILE
ICCAP_LICENSE_FILE
GENESYS_LICENSE_FILE
SYSTEMVUE_LICENSE_FILE
GOLDENGATE_LICENSE_FILE
MBP_LICENSE_FILE
MQA_LICENSE_FILE
AMA_LICENSE_FILE
WAFERPRO_LICENSE_FILE
On Windows
InvokeLicense Managerfrom Keysight EEsof Software,Main Window > Toolsmenu.
Select theEnvironmenttab.
In theEnvironmenttab, look for the variable with the name resembling <PRODUCT>_LICENSE_FILE
format.
Verify if <PRODUCT>_LICENSE_FILE either points to the correct remote license server (for example,
port@license-server-machine or@license-server-machine ), or the path is correct pointing
to the correct local license file on the machine? If not, runLicense Setup Wizardto correct this.

3.<PRODUCT>_LICENSE_FILE is not explicitly defined in theWindows System Properties. This was
done for earlier versions of the software but should not be done with the current version. Doing so will
interfere withLicense Setup Wizard.
On Linux
Find out what <PRODUCT>_LICENSE_FILE is set to by echo $ADS_LICENSE_FILE command for
example.
Verify if <PRODUCT>_LICENSE_FILE either points to the correct remote license server (for example,
port@license-server-machine or@license-server-machine ), or the path is correct pointing
to the correct local license file on the machine. On Linux, special care is needed because this
variable may have been declared somewhere in the environment startup files such
as .adsrc, .eesofpvmprofile, or .flexlmrc.
Communications problem from client machine to remote server (Remote Server Only)
This only needs to be checked if license server is a remote machine or iflmutil lmstatwas not
previously run as described in the section Verify license server machine is running, FlexNet daemon
versions, license server communications .
Run lmutil lmstat -c port@license-server-machine or lmutil lmstat -c
@license-server-machine . If the following output is seen,
AND it has been verified that the remote license server is running, then FlexNet communications are
blocked: See special section on dealing with blocked FLEXnet communications.
Step 3: Verify pool and accessibility of available licenses
In this stage of the troubleshooting flow, the license server is presumed to be running with correct
lmgrdandagileesofdversion v11.9 , and the License path has been correctly set. However,
license denials are preventing the access to software or access to features of the software. The
following items are checked in this section:
The pool of available licenses has the correct features, license version number, expiration date.
Multiple end user license server only: The pool of available licenses has licenses available (for example,
someone else might have checked out a license that is needed).
Remote server only: License file does not have floating licenses.

2.The pool of available licenses has the correct features, license version number, expiration date
This section checks the licenses in the license pool for correct features, correct license version
number, and unexpired licenses. Wrong features, wrong license versions, and expired licenses can
result in license denials.
On Windows
InvokeLicense Managerfrom Keysight EEsof SoftwareMain Windows > Toolsmenu.
Select theLicensestab. Example below has Product=ADS.

c.In the above platform illustrations (Windows, Linux), a query is performed on license servers
27001@cinnamon.ind and 27001@trident.scs , respectively (where, cinnamon.ind and
trident.scs are the name of the license server machines). The following information is obtained:
A listing of the features the license pool offers.
All features are version 3.0 licenses.
There are 200 licenses for each feature.
Licenses expire on September 13, 2012 .
Features are those belonging to agileesofd vendor daemon.
Given the above, the following items should be confirmed:
Features- Do the features appearing agree with what you believe are the features you own?
Version number- Ensure that the version number of software you are running or trying to run
correlates to its associated license version number:
Software Version License Version
2012 and 2 versions back 3.0
2011 and 2 versions back 2.9
2010 and 2 versions back 2.8
For example, if you are trying to run ADS 2012.08 on your machine but point to a license server with
v2.9 codewords, a license denial will occur.
Number of Licenses- Are the number of licenses 1 or greater for needed licenses?

2.Remote server only: License server has one or more node-locked licenses
In some instances, the license server is working, the client setup is correct, licenses are available for
use (not in use by others), licenses version show correct version and are not expired, but a license
still cannot be checked out. This can be caused by accidental installation of a node-locked license
file tied to the CPU ID of the machine intended to be the network (floating) license server. To verify
this, the following steps are performed:
Perform procedure described in MULTIPLE END USER LICENSE SERVER ONLY: The pool of available
licenses has licenses available step to get a listing of licenses on server.
Alternatively, run the FlexNet Utility, lmutil lmdiag -c @license-server <feature-
name to be checked>
In case of node-locked licenses, you will see in the last line, "This license cannot be checked out". In
the example above, it shows b_ads_inclusive can be checked out, inferring a correct network
license file has been installed.
FlexNet Communications Problems
This section should not be consulted unless it has been ascertained that the license server, local or
remote, is running.
Licensing (For Administrators)
82FlexNet communications can be blocked and/or interfered with by third party programs. This
section addresses how to resolve these issues. FlexNet communication blockage and/or
interference is most typically caused due to firewalls, and less often, with antivirus software, which
is covered here. However, it can also be caused from VPN tunnel programs and/or other third party
programs. Blockage/interference from those programs is beyond the scope of this.
Since, firewall and antivirus software is a typical cause for FlexNet communication problems, this
should be investigated first. The quickest way to make this determination is to temporarily disable
firewall and antivirus software.
Ensure that disabling any security software (for example, firewall, antivirus) is done in such a manner
that it does not cause harm to your system. Keysight cannot be held responsible for the harm caused. It
is also recommended that you work with local IT support professional.
The test is performed by methodically running lmutil lmstat -c @license-server
across different permutations of disabling firewall and antivirus software. When lmstat reports
license path, lmgrd and agileesofd vendor daemons UPafter a firewall or antivirus
disablement. This is a positive test result. lmstat result shown when no communications
blockage:
Below is an example test matrix. It is recommended to start with Firewall disabling first.

If both firewall and antivirus, on server and client machines, are simultaneously disabled (in other
words, all security software on license client and server turned off) and lmstat does not give a
positive result, then some third party software might be causing the issue. Request your IT
professional to check the same.
If after running the above tests, an interfering firewall and/or antivirus is determined; exceptions
must be made into these tools so that the FlexNet software functions properly. The steps to do this
are covered here. However, due to the wide variation in firewall and antivirus user interfaces and
use models, only generic instructions are provided.
Edit the current license file on license server machine. A port number should be added for both the
license manager daemon lmgrd and the agileesofd vendor daemon. These are shown below.SERVERthis_hostB8AC6F80C09D27005VENDORagileesofdPORT=5346#INCREMENTb_hb_layout_momentumagileesofd2.931-mar-20131VENDOR_STRING&hellip;..Stop and re-start license server so that these changes can take effect.
Firewall and Antivirus exclusions:
Firewall: Specify TCP port numbers 27005 and 5346 to be allowed through firewall for both License
server and License client machines

84Glossary and Abbreviations
The following table lists commonly used licensing terms and abbreviations in EEsof Licensing.
Term Definition
Keysight Software Manager (KSM)An interactive self-help license management system that allows you to
redeem, transfer, request, and renew licenses.
Feature A single capability that is used to construct an element or a bundle license
(for example, ads_schematic, sim_linear, and so on).
Elements An element includes one or more features. It is the lowest level of license
sold. All the features therein are reserved when the element is checked
out.
Bundle A bundle includes all the features from the elements that make up the
bundle. It is sold as a whole and all the features therein are reserved when
the bundle is checked out.
CPU ID CPU ID specifies the unique ID of a machine. It is also referred to as MAC
address or the physical address or hostid of a computer system.
Distributed SimulationA simulation divided into multiple jobs that runs concurrently on one or
more computers.
FlexNet FlexNet is the 3rd-party licensing technology Keysight EEsof licensing
scheme is based on.
FlexNet ID Dongle A license dongle is a serialized hardware key that can be attached to a
USB port of a computer to limit or lock software access to whoever has the
dongle attached to his/her system via the associated Keysight EEsof
license file. A license dongle always has a unique ID called FlexNet ID.
FlexNet ID Dongle Device DriversFlexNet ID Dongle Device Drivers must be installed before the dongle
device can serve as the locking device for license.
Floating (Network) LicenseA floating (network) license can be shared among multiple users across a
network. It can be installed on a license server using a CPU ID or a dongle
to fulfill the license requests from one or more client machines. License
server and client machine are different machines. Floating license support
is provided for single and multiple servers (including distributed product
servers, peak servers, and redundant servers).
Licensing (For Administrators)
85Term Definition
Hot Swapping An automatic release of a pulled bundle or core/environment license and
replace it with a different bundle type during run-time and check-out of
another bundle license.
Job Control A means to enforce a license count for a feature per each job invocation. A
feature has job control if each invocation of it consumes one count of its
associated license. Job control is used to limit the amount of concurrent
usage of a feature within one count of its encompassing element or bundle
consumption. Job controlled features include simulators and model sets.
License File The Keysight EEsof licenses are stored in a file. The license files are locked
to the license server using an identity obtained from the machine. This
identity is the CPU ID.
License Pool A license pool is a collection of purchased licenses.
License Security Licenses are secured by a codeword tied to a CPU ID or USB Dongle.
License Server Manager (lmgrd)lmgrdis one of the component in FlexNet technology. It is the license
daemon process running on the license server system to police the license
usage.
License Setup WizardLicense Setup Wizard offers a guided tour to assist the user to set up his/
her license. It is the recommended method for the Windows users who use
node-lock counted licenses locked to his/her PC or a dongle device.
License Tools Includes License Manager, License Setup Wizard, and Product Selector.
Load Sharing Facility (LSF)Load Sharing Facility (LSF) is a general-purpose, distributed queuing
system. Instead of submitting jobs to specific host machines, you can
submit them to a centralized queue manager. LSF distributes jobs to
available hosts based on the current load conditions and the resource
requirements of the application. It supports sequential and parallel
applications running as interactive and batch jobs. LSF is a third party
software tool by Platform Computing that makes distributed simulation
possible. Sun Grid Engine, a different third party tool that functions similar
to LSF, is also supported.
Node-locked LicenseNode-locking means that the application can be used on a specific host. It
allows a single instance of an Keysight EEsof product to be used on a
single computer with a single display. The user, license, and computer
must be physically co-located.
Primitives Primitives are obsolete, legacy product features. These are now contained
within new elements, mainly for migration purpose.

86Term Definition
Remote Simulation A simulation launched on a remote computer.
UDH UDH stands for User, Display, and Host. All Keysight EEsof licenses are
tied to a single user, single display, and single host.
Vendor Daemon (agileesofd)Keysight EEsof vendor daemon is calledagileesofd. It partners with
FlexNet license manager,lmgrd, to perform license usage policing for the
license codewords issued by Keysight EEsof.
